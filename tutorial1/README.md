# REST quipper

Quipper will let you manage your quips. You can add quips to your quips database, retrieve random quips, and get a count of how many quips you've collected. 

If you find yourself feeling especially nihilistic you can even drop all your quips and start over.

## Usage

>    $> java -jar quipper-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

or, if you're in development mode

>    $> lein run -- [args]

## Options

    -h,--help Prints the help information
    -f,--file provides an alternate file for quip storage.
        (used in testing but you can use it, too)
	-p,--port Provide to port to run quipper web service on
